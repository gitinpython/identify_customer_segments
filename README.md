# Project: Identify Customer Segments

This is a graded project which is a part of the Udacity Nanodegree program of "Introduction to Machine Learning wuth Tensorflow". Here, we will apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data that will be used has been provided by our partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics.
